# The-Amazing-Race

**Objective:** The goal of this project is to create a simple, working, browser-based racing game.

## Technologies used:
This project uses jQuery and Bootstrap.js.

## Current and planned features:
I finished as much as I could. Had I been able to implement what I wanted fully, this game would have had a more fleshed out, visually appealing racing avatar selection. I also would have had a selection of various world cities (London, Paris, Tokyo, Beijing, etc.) so that when the user refreshed the page, would load an entirely different set of world cities for a more theme-appropriate Amazing Race.

Nonetheless, future refactoring is always a possibility.
